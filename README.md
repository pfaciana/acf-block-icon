# ACF Block Icon

This plugin is to be used as a temporary solution to solve the issue defined here: [Gutenberg Block Custom SVG Icon Not Displaying](https://support.advancedcustomfields.com/forums/topic/gutenberg-block-custom-svg-icon-not-displaying/). The expectation is that once that issue is resolved, this plugin will no longer be needed.

This is a drop-in replacement solution. You should write your code as defined in ACF's documentation here: [acf_register_block()](https://www.advancedcustomfields.com/resources/acf_register_block/). Once this issue is resolved, just deactivate the plugin. Your code should not need to be modified in order to work.
